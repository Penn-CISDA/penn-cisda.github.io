This is a sample guide! You can use *Markdown* and **HTML** to format your text.

Make sure you title the file like this:
YYYY-MM-DD-title-words-separated-with-hyphen.md

If your guide doesn't show up on the website, you probably named the file wrong!

You can do a table of contents like this:
- toc
{:toc}

# Header 1
The table of contents will use headers to update itself.

## Header 1.1
Don't forget to update the title, submitted_by, and submitted_by_url (your website) fields above.
