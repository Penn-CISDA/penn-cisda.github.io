# What are the goals and purpose of CISDA?
- Provide a medium for student issues to be brought to the department
- Ensure that students are socially engaged across labs/programs within CIS
- Provide ‘go-to’ students for graduate coordinators
- Provide familiar faces for new PhD students
- Provide a medium for students to organize social events (e.g. intramural sports, hiking)
- Build closer relationships between graduate students, postdocs, and faculty within CIS
- Organize joint events with existing student governments within other departments (MEGA, ESEGA, GABE, ChEGA)

# What is the structure of CISDA?
- CISDA will represent PhD students in the Department of Computer and Information Science
- The CISDA board will consist of two to three co-chairs and other student volunteers
- The co-chairs will ensure that each program has a representative at all times during the academic year, and will ensure continuity of CISDA from year to year
- The CISDA board will elect one student to attend GSEG meetings as the PhD departmental representative
- The CISDA board will elect PhD student representatives to attend CIS faculty meetings (usually two who alternate)
- The CISDA board will meet regularly (monthly) for strategy meetings and status updates
- Program representatives will stay in regular contact with program coordinators
- Program representatives will use both GSEG and department funds and work with department coordinators to plan social and academic events for their fellow students
- Co-chairs will be selected/elected at the end of the spring semester
- Program representatives will be selected/elected at the start of each fall semester

# Where does CISDA fit into the hierarchy of student governments at Penn?
- GAPSA (Graduate and Professional Student Association) represents all graduate students at Penn (~12,000 students)
- GSEG (Graduate Student Engineering Group) represents graduate students within SEAS (~1,400 students)
- CISDA (Computer and Information Science Doctoral Association) represents PhD students within the CIS department (~150 students)

# How is CISDA funded?
- The money trail: CISDA receives funds from GSEG, which receives funds from GAPSA, which receives funds through graduate student fees (which are paid by PhD advisors, grants, fellowships, etc.)
- The CIS department can provide additional funding for events upon request
