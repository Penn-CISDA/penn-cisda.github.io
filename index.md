title: Welcome to CISDA!
---
The Computer and Information Science Doctoral Association (CISDA) is a
student-run organization that advocates for PhD students in the [Department of 
Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"} (CIS) within the 
[School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the 
[University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

We used to be called CIS*G*A, short for CIS *Graduate* Association. Because of 
the size of our department---we have over 150 PhD students alone, while some 
departments have 150 graduate students total!---we have historically focused on 
issues related to PhD students, so we changed our name to match. Masters 
students in the CIS department are now represented by associations for their 
individual programs. If you're a CIS masters student and need help finding your 
student leadership, feel free to send us an email.

We communicate frequently with the Department Chair and Graduate Group Chair, 
send a representative to the Graduate Student Engineering Group (GSEG), attend 
[faculty meetings](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fKvY9u13pnsx5yP1CO8KFTIDb2ygRP82?usp=sharing){:target="_blank"}, and host social events and town halls. We are always happy to 
chat, whether it's just to say hi, give pointers to resources, or discuss more 
serious issues. Send us an email at 
[cisda-chairs@seas.upenn.edu](mailto:cisda-chairs@seas.upenn.edu){:target="_blank"} (small group 
of CISDA student leaders) or 
[cisda-board@seas.upenn.edu](mailto:cisda-board@seas.upenn.edu){:target="_blank"} (broader group 
of all CISDA members). You can also reach out to [one of us](/people) directly 
or fill out our <a href="https://forms.gle/TKztGT46pPWcy8qn9" target="_blank">feedback form</a>
(with the option to be anonymous).
