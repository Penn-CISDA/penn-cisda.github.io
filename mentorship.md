The Mentorship Program was founded in 2022 by Alyssa Hwang, and aims to connect first and second year PhD students with senior PhD students for 1-1 mentoring.


We organize fun monthly outings for Mentorship Program participants!
Past activities have included an escape room, candle making, ice skating, and more!
